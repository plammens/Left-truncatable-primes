# Left-truncatable-primes
Small C++ program for finding or playing with left-truncatable primes. 

Made with Visual Studio; 'stdafx.h' is the precompiled header. 
Main source file is 'TruncatablePrimes.cpp'. 
'Colors.h' contains utilities to change the color of console output, and was written by Vincent Godin. It is Windows based, so it won't work for other OS's.
'TruncatedPrime.h' contains the (inline) definition of the class TruncatedPrime.
'Functions.h' (CURRENTLY NOT USED) collects definitions of functions used by main source.
