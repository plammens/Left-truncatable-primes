# Left-truncatable-primes
Small C++ program for finding or playing with left-truncatable primes. 

Made with Visual Studio; 'stdafx.h' is the precompiled header. 
Main source file is 'TruncatablePrimes.cpp'. 
'Colors.h' contains utilities to change the color of console output, and was [written by Vincent Godin](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/16431/Add-color-to-your-std-cout). It is Windows based, so it won't work for other OS's.
'TruncatedPrime.h' contains the (inline) definition of the class TruncatedPrime.
'Functions.h' (CURRENTLY NOT USED) collects definitions of functions used by main source.
